abstract = "We derive the fraction of substructure in the Galactic halo using a sample of over 10,000 spectroscopically confirmed halo giant stars from the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) spectroscopic survey. By observing 100 synthetic models along each line of sight with the LAMOST selection function in that sky area, we statistically characterize the expected halo populations. We define as Stellar Halo Accretion Related Debris Structures (SHARDS) any stars in $\\gt 3\\sigma$ excesses above the model predictions. We find that at least 10% of the Milky Way (MW) halo stars from LAMOST are part of SHARDS. By running our algorithm on smooth halos observed with the LAMOST selection function, we show that the LAMOST data contain excess substructure over all Galactocentric radii $R\\_{\\rm GC} \\lt 40$ kpc, beyond what is expected due to statistical fluctuations and incomplete sampling of a smooth halo. The level of substructure is consistent with the fraction of stars in SHARDS in model halos created entirely from accreted satellites. This work illustrates the potential of vast spectroscopic surveys with high filling factors over large sky areas to recreate the merging history of the MW."

#abstract_short = "A mobile visual clothing search system is presented whereby a smart phone user can either choose a social networking image or capture a new photo of a person wearing clothing of interest and search for similar clothing in a large cloud-based ecommerce database. The phone's GPS location is used to re-rank results by retail store location, to inform the user of local stores where similar clothing items can be tried on."

#caption = "Projections of the orbit of BooIII in Galactic Cartesian coordinates, as well as its MW distance as a function of time. The light cyan orbits represent different realizations drawn from the error distributions on our measured distances, velocities, and proper motions. Dark blue lines represent the orbit based on the mean properties of BooIII, with solid lines showing the forward integration, and dashed lines the past trajectory of BooIII."
