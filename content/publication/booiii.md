abstract = "We present proper motion (PM) measurements of Boötes III, an enigmatic stellar satellite of the Milky Way (MW), utilizing data from the second data release of the Gaia mission. By selecting 15 radial velocity confirmed members of Boötes III, along with a likely RR Lyrae member in the vicinity, we measure an error-weighted mean PM of ($\\mu\\_{\\alpha {\\rm cos} \\delta}, \\mu\\_{\\delta} ) = (−1.14, −0.98) \\pm (0.18, 0.20)$ mas/yr. We select and present further stars that may be Boötes III members based on their combined PM and position in the color-magnitude diagram. We caution against assigning membership to stars that are not confirmed spectroscopically, as we demonstrate that there are contaminating stars from the disrupting globular cluster NGC 5466 in the vicinity of the main body of Boötes III, but we note that our results are consistent with previous Boötes III PM estimates that did not include spectroscopic members. Based on the measured PM and other known properties of Boötes III, we derive its Galactocentric velocity and compute its orbit given canonical MW potentials with halo masses of both $0.8 \\times 10^{12} M\\_\\odot$ and $1.6 \\times 10^{12} M\\_\\odot$. These orbits robustly show that Boötes III passed within $\\sim12$ kpc of the Galactic center on an eccentric orbit roughly 140 Myr ago. Additionally, the PM of Boötes III is in excellent agreement with predictions for the retrograde motion of the coincident Styx stellar stream. Given this, along with the small pericenter and metallicity spread of Boötes III itself, we suggest that it is a disrupting dwarf galaxy giving rise to the Styx stellar stream."

caption = "Projections of the orbit of BooIII in Galactic Cartesian coordinates, as well as its MW distance as a function of time. The light cyan orbits represent different realizations drawn from the error distributions on our measured distances, velocities, and proper motions. Dark blue lines represent the orbit based on the mean properties of BooIII, with solid lines showing the forward integration, and dashed lines the past trajectory of BooIII."
