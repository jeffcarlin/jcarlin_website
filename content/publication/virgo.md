abstract = "We present three-dimensional space velocities of stars selected to be consistent with membership in the Virgo stellar substructure. Candidates were selected from SA 103, a single $40' \\times 40'$ field from our proper-motion (PM) survey in Kapteyn's Selected Areas (SAs), based on the PMs, Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) photometry, and follow-up spectroscopy of 215 stars. The signature of the Virgo substructure is clear in the SDSS color-magnitude diagram (CMD) centered on SA 103, and 16 stars are identified that have high Galactocentric-frame radial velocities ($V\\_{\\rm GSR} > 50$ km/s) and lie near the CMD locus of Virgo. The implied distance to the Virgo substructure from the candidates is $14 \\pm 3$ kpc. We derive mean kinematics from these 16 stars, finding a radial velocity $V\\_{\\rm GSR} = 153 \\pm 22$ km/s and proper motions $(\\mu\\_{\\alpha {\\rm cos} \\delta}, \\mu\\_\\delta) = (- 5.24, -0.91) \\pm (0.43, 0.46)$ mas/yr. From the mean kinematics of these members, we determine that the Virgo progenitor was on an eccentric ($e \\sim 0.8$) orbit that recently passed near the Galactic center (pericentric distance $R\\_{\\rm p} \\sim 6$ kpc). This destructive orbit is consistent with the idea that the substructure(s) in Virgo originated in the tidal disruption of a Milky Way satellite. N-body simulations suggest that the entire cloud-like Virgo substructure (encompassing the Virgo Overdensity and the Virgo Stellar Stream) is likely the tidal debris remnant from a recently disrupted massive ($\\sim 10^9 M\\_\\odot$) dwarf galaxy. The model also suggests that some other known stellar overdensities in the Milky Way halo (e.g., the Pisces Overdensity and debris near NGC 2419 and SEGUE 1) are explained by the disruption of the Virgo progenitor."

#abstract_short = "A mobile visual clothing search system is presented whereby a smart phone user can either choose a social networking image or capture a new photo of a person wearing clothing of interest and search for similar clothing in a large cloud-based ecommerce database. The phone's GPS location is used to re-rank results by retail store location, to inform the user of local stores where similar clothing items can be tried on."

#caption = "Radial ($V\\_{\\rm R}$, upper panels) and vertical ($V\\_{\\rm Z}$, lower panels) components of the Galactocentric velocities of stars between $7.8 < R\\_{\\rm GC} < 9.8$ kpc as a function of positions in Z and θ (left column) and Z, R (right column). Circles denote LAMOST data, and small squares are derived from RAVE velocities. Each colored point represents the mean value of all stars within a bin 200 pc wide in R and Z, and 13 in θ. All bins contain at least 50 stars, and some contain many thousands of stars. The dots are centered at the mean position of the stars within each subsample, and color encodes the mean $V\\_{\\rm R}$ or $V\\_{\\rm Z}$ according to the scale given by the color bar at the top. Apparent radial features in the right panels are artifacts consistent with ~20%–30% errors in the distances."
