abstract = "The radial number density and flattening of the Milky Way's stellar halo is measured with 5351 metal-poor ([Fe/H] < -1) K giants from The Large sky Area Multi-Object fiber Spectroscopic Telescope Data Release 3 (LAMOST DR3), using a non-parametric method, which is model independent and largely avoids the influence of halo substucture. The number density profile is well described by a single power law with index $5.03^{+0.64}_{-0.64}$ and flattening that varies with radius. The stellar halo traced by LAMOST K giants is more flattened at smaller radii, and becomes nearly spherical at larger radii. The flattening, $q$, is about 0.64, 0.8 and 0.96 at $r = 15, 20$ and $30$ kpc (where $r=\\sqrt{R^2+[Z/q\\(r\\)]^2}$), respectively. Moreover, the leading arm of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy tidal stream in the north, and the trailing arm in the south, is significant in the residual map of density distribution. In addition, an unknown overdensity is identified in the residual map at $(R, Z) = (30, 15)$ kpc."

#abstract_short = "A mobile visual clothing search system is presented whereby a smart phone user can either choose a social networking image or capture a new photo of a person wearing clothing of interest and search for similar clothing in a large cloud-based ecommerce database. The phone's GPS location is used to re-rank results by retail store location, to inform the user of local stores where similar clothing items can be tried on."
