abstract = "We describe a general target selection algorithm that is applicable to any survey in which the number of available candidates is much larger than the number of objects to be observed. This routine aims to achieve a balance between a smoothly-varying, well-understood selection function and the desire to preferentially select certain types of targets. Some target-selection examples are shown that illustrate different possibilities of emphasis functions. Although it is generally applicable, the algorithm was developed specifically for the LAMOST Experiment for Galactic Understanding and Exploration (LEGUE) survey that will be carried out using the Chinese Guo Shou Jing Telescope. In particular, this algorithm was designed for the portion of LEGUE targeting the Galactic halo, in which we attempt to balance a variety of science goals that require stars at fainter magnitudes than can be completely sampled by LAMOST. This algorithm has been implemented for the halo portion of the LAMOST pilot survey, which began in October 2011."

#abstract_short = "A mobile visual clothing search system is presented whereby a smart phone user can either choose a social networking image or capture a new photo of a person wearing clothing of interest and search for similar clothing in a large cloud-based ecommerce database. The phone's GPS location is used to re-rank results by retail store location, to inform the user of local stores where similar clothing items can be tried on."

#caption = "Radial ($V\\_{\\rm R}$, upper panels) and vertical ($V\\_{\\rm Z}$, lower panels) components of the Galactocentric velocities of stars between $7.8 < R\\_{\\rm GC} < 9.8$ kpc as a function of positions in Z and θ (left column) and Z, R (right column). Circles denote LAMOST data, and small squares are derived from RAVE velocities. Each colored point represents the mean value of all stars within a bin 200 pc wide in R and Z, and 13 in θ. All bins contain at least 50 stars, and some contain many thousands of stars. The dots are centered at the mean position of the stars within each subsample, and color encodes the mean $V\\_{\\rm R}$ or $V\\_{\\rm Z}$ according to the scale given by the color bar at the top. Apparent radial features in the right panels are artifacts consistent with ~20%–30% errors in the distances."
