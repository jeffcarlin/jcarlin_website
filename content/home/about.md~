# About me

I am an astrophysicist, currently working as a Science Validation Scientist in the Data Management (DM) subsystem at the Project Office of the [Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST)](https://lsst.org). In this role, I will be planning and executing acceptance test campaigns to verify that DM products meet the requirements laid out in the LSST DM Science Requirements Document (i.e., did we build what we said we would build?). I will also be working with the science community to conduct validation campaigns by which we will ensure that the DM systems are enabling the science that LSST was designed to accomplish (i.e., did we build the right thing to do the science we want to do?). My research is focused on understanding the formation and evolution of our Milky Way and other nearby galaxies based on their populations of stars. Of particular interest is finding and measuring the properties of satellite dwarf galaxies that accompany most larger galaxies. I also work on measuring the motions and chemical abundances of stars in stellar streams around the Milky Way. Studying these remnants that are left behind when our Galaxy's gravitational field rips apart the satellite dwarfs helps us to infer the properties of the dwarf galaxies before they were swallowed by the Milky Way.
